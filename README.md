# Alive Server

**Alive** is an open source browser-based Framer editor for rapid prototyping. A [Sketch plugin](https://github.com/tomger/alive) makes it easy to upload typical Framer layers to the server.

## Get Started

- [Download] (https://github.com/tomger/alive-server/archive/master.zip) (Node.js & React project)
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the web server and the "Create react app" live environment.
- Install the Sketch plugin to upload an artboard to your local server. The plugin will open a specific project on **http://localhost:3001/edit/[sketch page id]** automatically.
